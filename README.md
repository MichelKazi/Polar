# Polar

This project was initially made to demonstrate my understanding of node and react and how a back end communicates with a front end.  
I used Sails and React to get and MVP out. But now that I'm working on this project for personal reasons I can refactor it however I want.  

So... it's being refactored into a Go back end, and I'll probably keep the front end in react.  

The niche of this dating app is that users won't be able to connect with people similar to them.   
Instead, users will only be able to potentially match with people who are different from them in some way.  
Hence the name: **Polar**
